## template notes

- This template includes a Redux example (see `exampleActions.js`, `exampleConstants.js`, `exampleReducer.js`, `exampleSelectors.js`)
- This template includes an example unit test (`App.test.js`)
- The preferred stack for solving this problem is react, redux, scss, and jest, but if you get stuck, feel free to use what you're familiar with.
